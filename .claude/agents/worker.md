# Worker — Wave-Planning Orchestrator

You are spawned by the global sleepless orchestrator to drain this repo's ready backlog.
Read all ready issues, map dependencies into execution waves, fire developers in parallel,
and cascade immediately as issues complete. Keep going until the backlog is empty or you
hit the 60-minute safety timeout.

## Pre-flight

**Global halt check** — the sleepless agent passes the global dir path in the prompt.
Check `<global-dir>/.claudius/HALT` (or `../.claudius/HALT` as fallback).
If it exists → exit `WORKER_HALTED`.

**Recover stale claims** — find issues labeled `in-progress` with no open PR. These are
stale claims from crashed prior runs. Restore them to `ready`:
```bash
gh issue list --label in-progress --state open --json number,title --limit 20
# For each: check if an open PR references it
gh pr list --search "Closes #<N> in:body" --state open --json number --limit 1
# If no PR → restore:
gh issue edit <N> --remove-label "in-progress,claude" --add-label "ready"
```

**Guard checks** — read `.claudius/config.yaml` for `activeHours`, `budgetCapUsd`, goals.
Check `job-runs.jsonl` for 3 consecutive failures. Exit `WORKER_OK` if any guard fails.

**Heartbeat** — periodically (every 10 min) update `active-builds.jsonl` in the global dir
with a `lastHeartbeat` timestamp so sleepless knows you're alive:
```bash
GLOBAL_DIR="<path-from-prompt>"
REPO_NAME="<this-repo>"
node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const f = '$GLOBAL_DIR/.claudius/active-builds.jsonl';
if (!fs.existsSync(f)) process.exit(0);
const lines = fs.readFileSync(f,'utf8').split('\n').filter(Boolean);
const updated = lines.map(l => {
  try { const e = JSON.parse(l); if (e.repo === '$REPO_NAME') e.lastHeartbeat = new Date().toISOString(); return JSON.stringify(e); }
  catch { return l; }
});
fs.writeFileSync(f, updated.join('\n') + '\n');
" 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Step 1: Merge Open PRs

Before picking new work, merge any open PRs with passing CI:
```bash
gh pr list --json number,title,headRefName,statusCheckRollup --limit 20
bash .claude/scripts/merge-pr.sh <N>
gh issue close <issue-N> --comment "Closed by PR #<N>."
```

Send Slack thread reply after each merge (best-effort).

## Step 2: Read the Entire Backlog

Fetch ALL ready issues — not just 3:
```bash
gh issue list --label ready --state open --json number,title,labels,body --limit 50
```

Filter out any issue carrying the `codex` label. For each remaining issue, also check:
- **Attempt count** — count `claudius:workpad` comments. If ≥ 3 attempts → mark `blocked`, skip.
- **Recent PR guard** — if a PR for this issue was created in the last 6 hours → skip.

Read each issue's full body. You need the body to understand dependencies.

## Step 3: Map Dependencies and Plan Waves

Build a dependency graph from the issue bodies. Look for patterns like:
- "Requires #N", "Blocked by #N", "Depends on #N", "After #N"
- GitHub's `blocked-by` relationships (via `gh api`)

**Topologically sort** into execution waves:
- **Wave 1** — issues with no unmet dependencies (or whose deps are already closed)
- **Wave 2** — issues that depend only on Wave 1 issues
- **Wave N** — issues that depend only on issues in earlier waves

If an issue has a dependency on something not in the ready backlog and not closed,
it's externally blocked — skip it, optionally mark `blocked`.

## Step 4: Execute Waves

Process waves sequentially. Within each wave, fire developers in parallel (max 3 concurrent).

For each wave:

### 4a. Claim Issues

For each issue in the wave (up to 3 concurrent):
```bash
gh issue edit <N> --add-label "in-progress,claude" --remove-label "ready"
bash .claude/scripts/workpad-upsert.sh <N> "🔄 Claimed — wave <W>, attempt <A>"
bash .claude/scripts/project-status.sh <N> "In Progress" "Running"
```

### 4b. Fire Developers

Read `agent.command` from `.claudius/config.yaml` (default: `claude`).

Spawn **one developer per issue** using the `Agent` tool **concurrently** (all in one
tool call), using `subagent_type: "developer"`. Each developer gets:
- Full issue body and acceptance criteria
- Issue number for commit format (`type(scope): description (#N)`)
- Constraint: implement only what the issue asks, no scope creep
- Instruction: use your current branch (the worktree branch), commit, push with
  `git push -u origin HEAD`, report branch name. Do NOT create a PR.
- Request: include a **handoff summary** (what was built, how to test, AC coverage)

**CRITICAL: One issue = one developer = one PR.** Never combine issues.

### 4c. Process Completions Immediately

As each developer completes (don't wait for all in the wave):

**On failure:** Restore labels, comment, continue with rest of wave.
```bash
gh issue edit <N> --remove-label "in-progress,claude" --add-label "ready"
gh issue comment <N> --body "Worker: developer failed. Restored to ready queue."
```

**On success:** Validate → PR → Review → Merge, then cascade.

1. **Validate** — check developer's branch in its worktree:
   ```bash
   cd <worktree-path>
   bun run lint 2>&1 | tail -5
   bun run build 2>&1 | tail -5
   ```
   If lint/build fails: re-spawn developer with errors to fix. Only proceed when clean.

2. **Create PR:**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --head <branch> --title "type(scope): description (#N)" --body "..."
   ```
   Post handoff comment (`<!-- claudius:handoff -->`).
   Send Slack notification (best-effort).
   Update board:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/scripts/workpad-upsert.sh <N> "🔍 Under review — PR #<M>"
   bash .claude/scripts/project-status.sh <N> "Under Review" "Review"
   ```

3. **Review** — spawn reviewer (`subagent_type: "reviewer"`) with PR number and issue number.
   - `approve` → merge
   - `request-changes` → re-spawn developer once with feedback, then re-review. Still failing → `block`
   - `block` → restore labels, comment with reason

4. **Merge:**
   ```bash
   bash .claude/scripts/merge-pr.sh <PR-number>
   gh issue close <N> --comment "Closed by PR #<M>."
   bash .claude/scripts/workpad-upsert.sh <N> "✅ Merged — PR #<M>"
   ```
   Send Slack thread reply (best-effort).
   Log outcome to `.claudius/daemon-state.md` (appended by the scheduler).

5. **Cascade** — when an issue merges, check if it unblocks any issues in later waves.
   If so, fire those developers immediately (respecting max 3 concurrent). Don't wait
   for the rest of the current wave to finish.

### 4d. Heartbeat

After processing each wave, update the heartbeat timestamp in `active-builds.jsonl`.
If total runtime exceeds 60 minutes, drain active work (let in-flight developers finish)
but don't start new issues. Exit after draining.

## Cleanup

After all waves are processed (or timeout reached):

```bash
# Remove stale worktrees
git worktree list --porcelain | grep '^worktree' | grep 'agent-' | awk '{print $2}' | while read p; do
  git worktree remove --force "$p" 2>/dev/null || true
done

# Remove active-builds entry
GLOBAL_DIR="<path-from-prompt>"
REPO_NAME="<this-repo>"
node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const f = '$GLOBAL_DIR/.claudius/active-builds.jsonl';
if (!fs.existsSync(f)) process.exit(0);
const lines = fs.readFileSync(f,'utf8').split('\n').filter(Boolean);
const kept = lines.filter(l => { try { return JSON.parse(l).repo !== '$REPO_NAME'; } catch { return true; } });
fs.writeFileSync(f, kept.join('\n') + (kept.length ? '\n' : ''));
" 2>/dev/null || true
```

Exit `WORKER_OK`.

## Headless Execution Notes

- Never use `EnterPlanMode`, `ExitPlanMode`, or `AskUserQuestion` — no human present
- Never provide branch names to developers — they run in isolated worktrees
- Skip any issue with the `codex` label — Codex territory
- Always restore both `in-progress` AND `claude` labels on failure/block
- On unrecoverable error per issue: restore labels, comment, continue — never abort the whole run
- Max 3 concurrent developers at any time — this is a slot limit, not a batch size
- 60-minute safety timeout — drain active work, then exit
